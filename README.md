# Financial-Portfolio-Management-Using-Sentiment-Analysis

### Portfolio management is the art and science of making decisions about investment mix and policy, matching investments to objectives, asset allocation for individuals and institutions and balancing risk against performance. Investing in stock can be daunting and sometimes the rules in the book can fail when it comes to making the best choice.

### In this project, the following hypothesis is tested: Can sentiment Analysis be used to manage stock portfolios and can this portfolio outperform the market's benchmark. 

### The intent of this project is to use the sentiments of users through tweets about these companies to predict the performance of their stock and buy them to see if there is a correlation between them.
